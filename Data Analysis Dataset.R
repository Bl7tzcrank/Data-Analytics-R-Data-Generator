####R-Script for analysing the given dataset####
####Data set description###
# Data Generator for the present use-case
# The idea is to create a dataset of bought presents in 2017 in the "MÃ¼nsterland"
# ------------------------- list of features --------------------- #
# buyer_id -> different people buy different things, some of them buy more than one present, therefore, they need an identifier
# buyer_gender-> maybe there are differents in gender
# buyer_age-> older -> higher mean income -> more expensive presents
# buyer_annual_income -> the more income, the more expensive the presents
# article-> more a subgroup to specifiy what was bought
# article_group-> group, includes multiple subgroups
# article_price -> price of the present
# orderdate-> maybe more presents bought before christmas and easter
# packaging -> was the present packed?
# shop -> online vs store
# city -> where was it bought (store location or delvery "address")
# recipient_age -> age of recipient
# recipient_gender -> gender of recipient
# recipient_relation -> it is important if you by a present for your grandma or your boy-/girlfriend
